    We received a request to reset the password for your account. To complete the process, please use the following temporary password:

    ${temporaryPassword}

    For security reasons, we recommend changing your password after logging in. You can do this by navigating to your account profile and selecting the option to update your password.

    If you did not request a password reset, please ignore this email. Your account remains secure, and no changes have been made.

    Thank you,
